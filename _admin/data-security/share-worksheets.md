When you share a worksheet, you give users or groups within your cluster access to the worksheet's data. You share all of its columns. Sharing a worksheet does not share the underlying tables. If you want to share the underlying tables, see [Sharing tables and columns](share-source-tables.html#).

If you want to migrate the worksheet to another cluster, or otherwise export it, see [Migrate or restore worksheets]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/worksheet-export.html).

A worksheet can be shared by the owner of the worksheet, or by an administrator. Users can start searching a worksheet as soon as the worksheet is shared with them.

You can share a worksheet from the list of worksheets under **worksheets** [on the **Data** tab](#share-datatab), or from [within the worksheet](#share-dataset).
