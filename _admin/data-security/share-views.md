When you share a View, you share all of its data. Sharing a View does not share the underlying tables. If you want to share the underlying tables, see [Sharing tables and columns](share-source-tables.html#). A View can be shared by the owner of the View, or by an administrator. Users can start searching a View as soon as the View is shared with them.

You can share a View from the the list of Views under **Views** [on the **Data** tab](#share-datatab), or from [the View itself](#share-dataset).
