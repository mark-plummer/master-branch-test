SearchIQ is a different search experience that understands more natural, speech-like search language than [the original ThoughtSpot search or **Search+**]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-starting-a-new-search.html). For example, you can search for `What was my top selling product last month?`, instead of having to type `top 1 product by sales last month`. You can also speak your search using the voice-to-text capability of your operating system.

Users can easily [teach SearchIQ their language]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/teach-searchiq.html) as they use it. Over time, SearchIQ gets smarter about how to interpret terms that donâ€™t come directly from keywords, column names, or data values. In order to give it time to learn, the best practice recommendation is to enable SearchIQ for a small group of users initially. Over time you can roll it out to larger groups as SearchIQ learns what your users search for the most.

To enable SearchIQ on a ThoughtSpot instance:

1. Call ThoughtSpot Support and ask them to turn on SearchIQ for your ThoughtSpot instance.

2. Grant the **Can use experimental features** privilege to any group that should have access to the SearchIQ search experience.
