ThoughtSpot is installed or updated from a release tarball that contains the ThoughtSpot application (binaries and configuration), third-party software, and Operating System image. Third party softwares are licensed software components necessary for operation of the ThoughtSpot application. These include Java, Boost C++ libraries, Google protocol buffers, and so on.

ThoughtSpot patches the Operating System at the time of upgrades. Installation and upgrade use the same process, replacing the older OS image on a node by the new image delivered in the release tarball.
