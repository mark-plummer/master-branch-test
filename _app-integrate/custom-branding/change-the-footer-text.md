The ThoughtSpot footer appears by default in the ThoughtSpot application. It
also appears with an embed application that encompasses an individual pinboard
or a full application. In embed applications that have a single
visualization, you can ask your ThoughtSpot support engineer to disable the
footer.

While you cannot remove the footer, you can customize it by adding a
company-specific message.

## Add a message to the application footer

You can change the footer text to reflect your company's message. To change the
footer text:

1. Click the text box under **Footer text**.
2. Enter your new text message.

     ![Edit the footer text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/style-newfootertext.png "Edit the footer text")

    Your new text message will automatically be displayed in the footer.

     ![Footer text display]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/style-footertext.png "Footer text display")

3. Click the **Reset** button on the upper right hand side of the section if you would like to bring back the default footer text.
