Charts with X and Y axes can display gridlines. Y-axis gridlines provide horizontal gridlines, and X-axis gridlines provide vertical gridlines.

To display gridlines, follow these steps:

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click the **chart configuration** icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-gear-10px.png){: .inline} on the top right.

2. Click **Settings** at the bottom of the **Customize** menu.

2. Select one or both of the gridline options.

X-axis gridlines are useful when you have a more complicated chart. For example, if you view a column chart for **sales** by **department** and **store region**, you might want to use gridlines to more easily visualize the column groups. You might also use gridlines when your chart includes a **time** element.
