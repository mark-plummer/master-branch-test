You must have the following artifacts to install or upgrade ThoughtSpot applications that run on RHEL:

- The **Ansible tarball** contains a set of scripts for installing OS packages, dependencies, the ThoughtSpot CLI (tscli), and configuring your cluster (preparing the disks). Please join our RHEL Early Access program, and email us your <a href="mailto:early_access@thoughtspot.com?subject=RHEL%20Early%20Access%20Program%20Ansible%20File%20Request" target="_blank">Ansible request</a>.

- The **Release tarball** contains the ThoughtSpot software binaries (`tar.gz`) of the release version you are installing or upgrading; for example, ThoughtSpot Release 6.0.4. You can obtain this file from the <a href="https://thoughtspot.egnyte.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtSpot secure file sharing system</a>. We sent this information to you in our Welcome email. Contact ThoughtSpot Support if you experience difficulties accessing these files.
