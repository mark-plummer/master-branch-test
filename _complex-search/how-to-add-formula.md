You can add a formula directly within a search. Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add conditional logic.

## How to add a formula

To create a formula in a search:

1. Start a new search, or choose an existing answer from a pinboard to edit.
2. If the answer shows a chart, switch to **Table View**.

3. In the upper-right side of the table, click the three-dot **Actions** icon and select **Add formula**.

4. Name and enter your formula in the Formula Builder.

    {% include note.html content="Formulas elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions (blue), the names of columns (purple), and/or constants (black)." %}

5.  You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking **Formula Assistant.**

6.  If you want to change what your formula returns, use the **Advanced settings**. Depending on your formula, you may be able to change:

    -   Data type
    -   Measure or attribute
    -   Aggregation
